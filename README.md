# Hi! #

## Mandala Art/Painting ##
:paperclip: **Mandala art** is a symbolic representation of the cosmos, the circle representing completeness, eternity, infinite, and oneness. In several Asian civilizations, the mandala is a well-known spiritual and rites symbol.

## About the design ##
:paperclip: For this project, I experimented a variety of geometric shapes to create a wide range of patterns. I have used white background and black pen as I wanted it to look clean and simple. I was inspired by my grandma's pillow design that I love the most when I was a kid. Few months ago, I created a simple pattern which can be seen [here](https://github.com/phoebegrace/midterms/blob/main/mandala%20art.png). I realized that I still have to make it better by providing more geometric shapes and patterns that made me come up with [this design](https://github.com/phoebegrace/midterms/blob/main/mandala_revised.png)
