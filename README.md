# midterms project
Good Day Sir! I am really sorry for the late submission, I was really busy and drained this past few weeks. I tried my best to experiment a mandala art using python turtle. I am sorry too for my simple design, I can't make the one I have in mind since I really haven't made time to study python turtle, I only know the very few basics. Once all my works are settled, I will make time for this and will continue to learn independently. 
About my design, it was very simple, I used the mint green color background and a black pen for the mandala design. 
I tried doing research, I have watched Indian Youtubers to help me understand a code, and in them, I have accomplised my own mandala art XD.
